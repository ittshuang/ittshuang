      <description>As the title indicated, I personally haven&amp;rsquo;t find THE best way to do so. There is still a long way to go. But influenced by many people, I thing Github + Dropbox/Cluster works perfect, at least for now.&#xA;Github serves as a code hub where you can do version control and collaborate with co-authors. You can easily track all the changes on code. Dropbox or a computer cluster serves as cloud to store all the huge dataset.</description>

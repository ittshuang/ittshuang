I usually ran into some really intersting, useful and cool websites that want to share with you, who are willing to spend time reading my website:) I hope this is an archival that I can update frequently.

## Economics

* Visit [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) to see research about equality, migration, mobility and opportunity etc. 

## Research 

* Using [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/) to searching for relevant literatures. The network and visualization are really nice.

## Data

* Visit [China Data Institue](https://chinadatacenter.net/Default.aspx) (subscription required) for Chinese geographical and other data.

## Giants' Shoulder

* Visit [Yihui Xie's Homepage](https://yihui.org/) for everything about R Programming (This website is based on his tutorial!)
* Visit [Sangmin Simon Oh's Homepage](https://sangmino.github.io/) - it is fantastic and full of insights and useful resources for PhD students. He starts to run a new blog page [Better Know A Dataset (BKAD)](https://bkad.substack.com/) that showcases interesting datasets, highlighting noteworthy patterns and analyses.

**The paper**:  Arya, A., J. Fellingham, Jonathan Glover , D. Schroeder, and Gilbert Strang. “Inferring Transactions from Financial Statements.” Contemporary Accounting Research vol. 17, (January 01, 2000): 366-385.


## The Question

Given a set of financial statement $x$, what is the "best guess" of the underlying transaction vector $y$?

## The Solution

Four steps to form the solution:

1. Build a algebric representation for accounting process: $Ay=x$ ($A$ is the double entry matrix)
2. Identify the fundamental subspaces of $A$.
3. Given $x$, solve all possible $y$ that satisfy $Ay=x$.
4. Given the reader’s priors over $y$, derive the conditional mean of the consistent $y$ vectors.
